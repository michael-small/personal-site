# Michael Small's Portfolio Site

A React site to show off my skills.

The aim is to not only show the basics of my knowledge, but also show off some skills in demos on the site. I go over my reasoning for changes to the code in many commits to show off my thinking and learning process.

You can also view accompanying documentation in its own folder in the root.

### How to Run

`npm start`
